## AI Language Buddy

## Summary

This project is about using AI to help people learn new languages in an easy and fun way.  
**Building AI course project**

## Background

Learning a new language is difficult, especially if you don’t have a teacher or someone to practice with. Many apps teach languages, but they are not very personalized — they give basically the same lessons to everyone. I want to create a smart assistant that helps each person in a way that fits their level and needs.

## How is it used?

The AI assistant can help people by:
* Asking simple questions in the language
* Giving vocabulary and grammar exercises
* Helping with pronunciation using voice
* Repeating difficult words until you learn them

People can use it on their phone or computer, at home or in school.

## Data sources and AI methods

The system could use:
* Language example databases like [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org)
* Speech datasets like [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org)

AI techniques:
* Text analysis (to check your answers)
* Recommendation system (to choose what you should study next)
* Speech recognition (to help with pronunciation)

## Challenges

This tool may not replace your language teacher, but it can be work as some extra help.

Possible problems:
* Sometimes the AI might not understand your voice well
* Personal data must be protected

## What next?

In the future, this project could:
* Support more languages
* Include pictures and games
* Let users talk to each other with AI help

## Acknowledgments

* Idea inspired by other language learners and language-learning communities online.
* Open data from [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org) and [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org)
